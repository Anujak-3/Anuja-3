# Hi, I'm Anuja 👋

I'm a student currently exploring the world of data and analytics.  
I've been working with SQL Server and Power BI to build dashboards that don’t just look good but also tell real stories through data.

My latest project is an HR Attrition Dashboard where I analyzed factors affecting employee turnover using both SQL queries and Power BI visualizations.

I’m still learning, trying out new tools, and slowly building up my skills one project at a time.  
Feel free to check out my work — more coming soon!
